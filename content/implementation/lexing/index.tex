\section{Lexing}
Our formatter is built to do without parsing any code,
but we still need to split the input code into individual tokens.
Therefore, we will start by creating a lexer that can recognize
all the token types we defined for our lisp-like language,
including line and block comments from the comments extension.
We could use a parser generator such as ANTLR to generate a lexer only,
but due to the simple nature of our language,
a lexer will be sufficiently trivial to implement ourselves.

The lexer function has the signature
\begin{minted}{typescript}
(code: string) => {
  type: 'leftPar' | 'rightPar' | 'operator' | 'prefix' |
    'numLiteral' | 'boolLiteral' | 'keyword' | 'identifier' |
    'lineComment' | 'blockComment',
  value: string,
}[]
\end{minted}
, taking the input code as a string and returning an array of
token objects with a property \code{type} from a fixed pool of
strings that contains a type identifier
for each possible token that can occur in the code,
and a a property \code{value} that contains the
snippet from the input code that represents the corresponding token.
The token types are exactly those we defined in the language grammar,
plus \code{'lineComment'} and \code{'blockComment'}
for representing the comments we defined as an extension to the language,
which have no effect on the code semantics,
but are treated like any other token for the purpose of formatting.
