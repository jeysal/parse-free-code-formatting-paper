\subsection{Line comments}
For detecting line comments, we use the regular loop structure.
The initial detection checks for the semicolon character:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  if (char === ';') {
    // ...
  }
\end{minted}

The loop runs until the end of the line by checking for line breaks:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  do {
    // ...
  } while (char !== '\n');
\end{minted}
Line break characters may vary depending by operating system,
but we will assume \code{\n} for the sake of simplicity
and stay focused on the actual formatting algorithms.

After the loop, we push a token as usual and continue with the main loop.
