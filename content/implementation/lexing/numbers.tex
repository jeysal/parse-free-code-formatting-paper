\subsection{Number literals}
Number literals are a little more complex to recognize,
because they are the first token so far to have variable length.

Initial detection is simple using the a regex that matches digits:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  const numRegex = /[0-9]/;

  if (numRegex.test(char)) {
    // ...
  }
\end{minted}

But after the initial digit, the number literal may contain further digits.
We use a loop to collect them in a string,
running until we find a character that is not a digit:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  let numberLiteral = '';

  do {
    numberLiteral += char;
    char = code[++position];
  } while (numRegex.test(char));
\end{minted}

Afterwards, we can push the token as usual,
with the value set to the string of accumulated digits:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  tokens.push({ type: 'numLiteral', value: numberLiteral });
  continue;
\end{minted}
The \code{position} cursor has already been advanced
beyond the number literal in the last iteration of the loop,
so we do not need to increment it like we did in the other blocks.

This also implies that the lexer will accept any token
immediately after the number literal --- the code
\begin{minted}{lisp}
  (123abc)
\end{minted}
would be tokenized into the number literal \code{123}
and, by a rule we have yet to implement, the identifier \code{abc}.
The language might not allow this pattern to occur in the code
without any separating whitespace, so we may accept code that is not valid ---
and in this concrete case later reformat it to valid code that
conforms to what was likely the intended code in the first place:
\begin{minted}{lisp}
  (123 abc)
\end{minted}

In any case, accepting a superset of code that is actually valid
by the rules of the language is not something we can avoid,
because the lack of parsing means that
we can only check the validity of the input
according to the lexical grammar,
but not according to the syntactic grammar.
We can tolerate these instances of reformatting code that is invalid,
because our printing algorithm will never introduce significant changes
that destroy the code further and it will recover a well-formatted state
after the user fixes the code error and reformats once again.
