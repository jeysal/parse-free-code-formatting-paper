\subsection{Empty lines}
To detect empty lines in the input code,
we need to store an additional state variable
across iterations of the loop,
tracking the number of line breaks we have seen
without a token in between:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  let consecutiveBreaks = 0;
\end{minted}
We could alternatively initialize this variable to 1
if we wanted to also respect an empty line
right at the beginning of the code.

We need to reset the variable to 0
whenever we find a character
that is not whitespace and will thus either
generate a token or cause a lexer error.
We accomplish this by inserting the statement
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  consecutiveBreaks = 0;
\end{minted}
\textit{below} the if statement that checks for whitespace.

Finally, we increment the \code{consecutiveBreaks} counter
and push an \code{emptyLine} token if it has reached 2
by inserting the following code
\textit{above} the if statement that checks for whitespace:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  if (char === '\n')
    if (++consecutiveBreaks === 2)
      tokens.push({ type: 'emptyLine', value: '' });
\end{minted}
