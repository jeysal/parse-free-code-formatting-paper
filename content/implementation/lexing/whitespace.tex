\subsection{Whitespace}
Whitespace primarily includes spaces, tabs, line feeds and carriage returns,
all of which are characters which will not be included in any token
but may serve as separators between tokens,
for example two identifiers that would be treated as one
if there were no whitespace between them.

It can be matched with the regular expression:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  const whitespaceRegex = /\s/;
\end{minted}

We use that regular expression to skip all of it:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  if (whitespaceRegex.test(char)) {
    position++;
    continue;
  }
\end{minted}
