\section{Printing}
Once our lexer has tokenized the input code,
we pass the array of tokens it generated into the printer.
The printer will then generate well-formatted output code from those tokens.
Its signature is the inverse of the lexer:
\begin{minted}{typescript}
  (tokens: {
    type: 'leftPar' | 'rightPar' | 'operator' | 'prefix' |
      'numLiteral' | 'boolLiteral' | 'keyword' | 'identifier' |
      'lineComment' | 'blockComment' | 'emptyLine',
    value: string,
  }[]) => string
\end{minted}

The high-level structure of the printer function is as follows:
\begin{minted}{javascript}
  const print = tokens => {
    let code = '';
    // GLOBAL_STATE ...

    for (const { type, value } of tokens) {
      // PRE_PRINT ...

      // print token
      code += value;

      // POST_PRINT ...
    }

    return code;
  };
\end{minted}
The printer iterates over all input tokens
and prints them to the output code.
Outside of that loop, it holds some global state,
most notably the output code generated so far.
As we gradually implement
more functionality for the aspects of printing
over the course of this section,
we will add more state variables
as well as computations and further printing
before and after a token is printed in the loop.
