\subsection{Soft line breaks \& indentation}
% TODO regular indentation, not the aligning extension
% TODO greedy line breaks with separation avoidance and inevitable length violation recovery
% TODO move decrement of nestingLevel to PRE_PRINT, as required by 4.3.2 Indentation
% TODO possible to split this up and do indentation strictly after soft line breaks?
