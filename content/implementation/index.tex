\chapter{Implementing a formatter}
In this chapter, we will use the insight into formatting rules for our Lisp-like syntax that we gained
and the concrete algorithms we developed to implement a complete formatter that can transform
input code adhering to the syntax, regardless of its formatting, to
equivalent output code that fulfills our code formatting requirements.
% TODO we'll write this in JS
% TODO we need a lexer and a printer

\section{Lexing}
% TODO no parsing, but we still need to tokenize the input code
% TODO no point in using e.g. ANTLR, because we need no parser and the lexer is pretty trivial
% TODO gradually build up with code snippets
% TODO include comments extension

\section{Printing}
% TODO

\subsection{Spacing}
% TODO standard spacing conditions that we already defined

\subsection{Hard line breaks}
% TODO standard hard line break rules

\subsection{Soft line breaks and indentation}
% TODO regular indentation, not the aligning extension
% TODO greedy line breaks with separation avoidance and inevitable length violation recovery

\section{Formatting examples}
% TODO code examples both from earlier in the paper and from external lisp code
