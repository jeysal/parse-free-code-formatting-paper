\chapter{Implementing a formatter}
In this chapter, we will use the insight into formatting rules for our Lisp-like syntax that we gained
and the concrete algorithms we developed to implement a complete formatter that can transform
input code adhering to the syntax, regardless of its formatting, to
equivalent output code that fulfills our code formatting requirements.
We will write the formatter in JavaScript, compliant with ECMAScript 2018,
as two strictly separated functions that realize the lexing and printing steps.
