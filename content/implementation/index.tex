\chapter{Implementing a formatter}
In this chapter, we will use the insight into formatting rules for our Lisp-like syntax that we gained
and the concrete algorithms we developed to implement a complete formatter that can transform
input code adhering to the syntax, regardless of its formatting, to
equivalent output code that fulfills our code formatting requirements.
We will write the formatter in JavaScript, compliant with ECMAScript 2018,
as two strictly separated functions that realize the lexing and printing steps.

\section{Printing}
% TODO

\subsection{Spacing}
% TODO standard spacing conditions that we already defined

\subsection{Hard line breaks}
% TODO standard hard line break rules

\subsection{Soft line breaks \& indentation}
% TODO regular indentation, not the aligning extension
% TODO greedy line breaks with separation avoidance and inevitable length violation recovery

\section{Formatting examples}
% TODO code examples both from earlier in the paper and from external lisp code
