\paragraph{Avoiding undesired separation}
While this may seem like reasonable formatting style,
it is really just a lucky token arrangement and line length.
If we increase the line length by 1, the code we produce looks weird:
\begin{minted}{lisp}
  ; line size 26
  (let something)
  (identifier 012345 43210 (
      someIdentifier 0123456
      789))
\end{minted}
If we keep the line length but replace \code{identifier}
with \code{something}, something similar happens:
\begin{minted}{lisp}
  ; line size 25
  (let something)
  (something 012345 43210 (
      someIdentifier
      0123456 789))
\end{minted}

The most annoying issue about both of the `weird' code formats we produced is that
\code{someIdentifier} is separated from its preceding \code{leftPar} by a line break,
especially because the same thing is not applied to the code snippets
\code{(identifier} or \code{(something} that occur earlier and have the same structure.
We want to avoid the separation of token sequences like \code{(x}
and its counterpart \code{y)}, including the case where multiple subsequent
parentheses occur: \code{((x} or \code{y))}.
We also want to avoid a similar separation issue if a break
is inserted immediately after a prefix token,
so constructs like \code{&x} always remain together.
The latter would not only look terrible, it may also be forbidden by some languages
with special treatment of prefixes.

We notice that for the language we are dealing with,
the token pairs that must not be separated by line breaks
are exactly those token pairs that do not allow the insertion of a space between them.
Because of this, we can base a system of line break allowance on our established spacing rules,
effectively treating tokens that are printed with no space inbetween them as single tokens.

This makes the two problematic examples more bearable
and in this case even uniform among one another
as well as consistent with the unproblematic example:
\begin{minted}{lisp}
  ; line size 26
  (let something)
  (identifier 012345 43210
    (someIdentifier 0123456
      789))

  ; line size 25
  (let something)
  (something 012345 43210
    (someIdentifier 0123456
      789))
\end{minted}
