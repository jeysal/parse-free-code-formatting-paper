\subsection{Soft line breaks}
As mentioned before, the placement of soft line breaks is the most complicated aspect,
but also a well-explored one, with many good algorithms already developed and in use.
Most of those are also quite efficient as far as time and space complexity are concerned,
usually requiring asymptotically linear resources as the number of tokens in a line grows.

% simple algs (just break it up in the middle, then at 1/4 + 3/4, etc, see intro:softLineBreaks)
