\subsection{Spacing}
For our Lisp-like syntax, we want to separate most tokens with a space, with the following exceptions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item No space after a \code{leftPar},
  \item no space before a \code{rightPar} and
  \item no space after a \code{prefix}, which is not visible in the example.
\end{itemize}

To achieve this, all we need to do is define for each type of token
whether it allows a leading space and whether it allows a trailing space.
Then, we can look up between every two tokens
whether the token on the left allows a trailing space and
whether the token on the right allows a leading space and
insert a space only if both do.
Applying this procedure on the tokens
\begin{minted}{text}
  (, a, (, ', b, c, ), )
\end{minted}
results in the code output:
\begin{minted}{lisp}
  (a ('b c))
\end{minted}
It also works for a prefix preceding a list, printing the tokens
\begin{minted}{text}
  (, a, ', (, b, c, ), )
\end{minted}
as
\begin{minted}{lisp}
  (a '(b c))
\end{minted}
