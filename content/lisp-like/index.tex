\chapter{Lisp-like syntax}
To gain insight on how a parse-free formatter could be built,
let us first take a look at a small language with Lisp-like syntax.
This is a good starting point because Lisp dialects tend to
have among the simplest lexical and syntactic grammars.
The language does not need to be complete enough for practical usage,
but it should reflect the core syntactic concepts that Lisps share.
