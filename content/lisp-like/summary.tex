\section{Summary}
In this chapter,
we used a simple Lisp-like language to explore
how we can design a formatting algorithm
based entirely on lexical information.
We found simple rules for
spacing and hard line breaks
and defined methods to generate output with
two distinct indentation styles.
We outlined multiple different ways
to insert soft line breaks
into overly long lines of code
and found ways to handle edge cases
such as the inevitable violation
of line length limits.

In the next chapter, we will pick
a concrete formatting style and
implement a formatter based on
the theoretical foundation layed out here.
