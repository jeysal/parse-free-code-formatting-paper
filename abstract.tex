  {\noindent\large\textbf{Abstract}\par}\noindent
  We propose an approach to code formatting
  based entirely on lexical analysis of the input code,
  disposing the need for expensive syntactic analysis.
  This approach has the potential to
  improve the resource efficiency of a formatter
  and make it easily adaptable to different languages,
  while sacrificing consistency and beauty
  of the output format to some degree.
  We develop a parse-free algorithm that handles
  all essential aspects of code formatting
  for a simple Lisp-like language.
  We implement a lexer and a printer
  adhering to this algorithm.
